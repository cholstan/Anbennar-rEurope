This breed of rabbit - known coloquially as the Chungus - can easily reach 5ft in both length and girth, reaching up to 6ft for especially big individuals. The practice of breeding Chunguses is a widespread pastime in Fangaula, leading to the countries nickname of 'Chungaula'. Contests are held throughout the land where breeders compete for the biggest specimen. This particular location holds the exhibition grounds for the countrywide competition where local champions go to showcase their chunguses on a larger stage and hopefully earn the prized title of 'Big Chungus' for their animal."
