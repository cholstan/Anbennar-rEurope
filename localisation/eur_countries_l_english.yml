 X01_ideas_bonus:0 "Gerudian Empire Ambition"
 X01_one:0 "Legacy of the Clans"
 X01_one_desc:0 "In olden times the ruler of a clan would be decided by battle. While this tradition has been a thing of the past we Gerudians still value strength of both body and mind, as well as an inclination to military matters. This is reflected in our rulers as well."
 X01_two:0 "A Reavers Life"
 X01_two_desc:0 "The life of a reaver is embedded deeply into our hearts and culture. To go out to sea, to plunder for slaves and treasure is as natural to us as breathing."
 X01_three:0 "Hardened by the frost"
 X01_three_desc:0 "The winters in Gerudia are cold and tough. It takes a certain type of hardyness and bodily strength that the southerners lack to survive in the cold north. This strong breed of people will not back down in the face of ice and frost, nor to a wound."
 X01_four:0 "The Thing of war"
 X01_four_desc:0 "While our administration is as modern as they come we do not forfeit our traditions. Once every year, at the eve of winter solstice, the leaders of the Gerudian clans meet for the great Thing. Matters of war and battle are discussed and the cheiftains compete, as much with words and strategies as with strength and blade. Whoever sets themself apart are appointed to advise the High King in matters of war."
 X01_five:0 "People of the sea"
 X01_five_desc:0 "We are a seafaring people though and through. While the great longboats are a thing of the past we still heavily rely on ships and boats to connect our Empire. Many a Gerudian has spent part of their lives on a ship, still as many have gone to war on one."
 X01_six:0 "Work or die"
 X01_six_desc:0 "You have no time to slack off in Gerudia. When the winter comes you had better been prepared, unless you want to freeze or starve to death. When the alternative is death, one tends to prefer to work hard."
 X01_seven:0 "Blood of Giants"
 X01_seven_desc:0 "The southerners often claim that Gerudians have inherited the blood of giants, that we are as related to trolls as to other men. While this is obviously untrue us Gerudians grow tall and broad and strong of body. When met in a melee the southerners are quickly dispatched by superior Gerudian strength and blade."

 X02_ideas:0 "Carneter Ideas"
 X02_ideas_start:0 "Carneter Traditions"
 X02_ideas_bonus:0 "Carneter Ambition"
 X02_one:0 "Paper Barons of Carneter"
 X02_one_desc:0 "After their partition, the lands of Carneter became dominated by local barons and their small baronies and shires. Reunification rather than destroy this ancient institution that survived the old kingdom saw fit to burden the barons with honours and duties.\nThese small lords with intricate knowledge of their land accrued across centuries could muster the kingdoms forces the best, and thus the paper barons were born - the chief administrative unit in both harvest and war. With the invention of wood pulp, this moniker received a second meaning, ensuring the title outlasts feudalism well into the 19th century as both a term for the kingdoms bureaucrats and for the nobles turned industrialists."
 X02_two:0 "A Vow in Wood"
 X02_two_desc:0 "Carnetori do not speak vows at their weddings. Their vow is as simple and sturdy as they are. The bride and groom bury seeds in the forest without a word. Then they celebrate, consummate and then cohabitate.\nAs long as their bond lasts, the newlyweds tend to the seeds sown that day. The trees they grow are the symbol of their love as well as their shared duty. Should one perish, their spouse takes on the duties of their spouse by taking the sole duty of nurturing these trees. And once both perish it is their offspring who claim these trees. For it is out of your parents love that you are born, and it is that love that you carve into your house, your wagon or your ship. This sharing of life, love and duty reverberates into Carnetori society, all the way up to its leadership and army."
 X02_three:0 "Reforestation of Eilsin"
 X02_three_desc:0 "Eilsin held the old capital of the kingdom, but the woods have since yielded to vineyard under Duke Lucian, and virtue fled before madness under Reanna. For the old capital to be restored, the forests need to be resown, spirits put to rest and magic must cleanse vile necromancy. Only once the woods are restored and nature has healed can we rebuild the city of Ilvandet."
 X02_four:0 "Ancard's stand"
 X02_four_desc:0 "'Here fell Ancard, whence comes such another?'\n\nA small plaque by Ancard's crossing poses a simple question for every Carnetori that passes. It is this question that the rank and file of Carneter is expected to answer, and the one posed again and again by their drillmasters. Thus, when Lorents knights come again, a Carnetori footman knows that he should strive to stand his ground until it gives in from under him."
 X02_five:0 "Between two titans"
 X02_five_desc:0 "Carneter has failed to balance its alliances and threats, and was thus partitioned. Its last embers had been snuffed out when Ilvandet married Eilsin.\nLorent and Anbennar have only grown in strength since those times and their crowns once again look outward. Lest we perish in a new Lilac war, our diplomats must not miss a step again in the grand concert of Cannor. While While other fleets sail to war, the Pearl Fleet boasts the swiftest frigates clutching simple treasures that can make or break a nation - seals, promises and the people that keep them."
 X02_six:0 "Wine, barrels and ships"
 X02_six_desc:0 "The reformation of the kingdom has seen the surprising blooming of an interconnected economy. As the woods of the heartland could now freely provide for the trade fleet of Pearlsedge and the wineyards of the northern fringes, which in turn could all be sold all in the ports or the south - the Carnetori economy has become greater than the sum of its parts. This simple abolition of tolls has become the tie that binds the kingdom together more than any other."
 X02_seven:0 "Bloomsdawn King"
 X02_seven_desc:0 "On the last week of bloomsdawn, all the barons men leave their castle posts and garrisons to array at their lieges gardenAs for the next week there will be an all out assault on the first springs flowers. Children from across a barons' shire have been planning the whole winter how best to sneak in and steal these early gifts of Halanna, and, for the entire week, they can now test their wits against their liege's sheriffs unrestrained.\nFrom their captured trophies they then craft wreaths of flowers and vines to present to the adults at the Bloomsdawn festival. Their Baron then arrives on horseback, and judging the crowns, picks a child to question. The baron questions the child where they found such a magnificent crown. The child replies that it was gifted to them by Halanna , and can only be taken by fell Dolumir. The shire then proclaims the child to be the Bloomsdawn King , and has them lead the festival procession, which  sprinkles seeds of flowers across the shire to welcome spring.\nThere is a deeper root to this festival however - it's a celebration of the Carnetori Yeoman who won his rights and courts in ancient times, and has not surrendered them to their baron since. Their Baron may rule, but he rules over freer men than those of Lorent."

 X04_ideas_start:0 "Damerian Republic Traditions"
 X04_ideas_bonus:0 "Damerian Republic Ambition"
 X04_one:0 "Friendly neighbourhood Heroes"
 X04_one_desc:0 "Anbencóst has long been the origin point and final destination of many adventures, providing the city with a varied roster of novice , experienced and retired heroes to recruit from in times of trouble. The new government of the republic has concluded that the secret to the city's success was in fact supply. Attracting adventurers with favourable reforms, the right to climb as high as any of the nobility of old  and, most importantly, plenty of attractions and shops to spend their loot on would ensure that for every problem that arises, ten hired heroes would respond."
 X04_two:0 "Waterworks of West Damesear"
 X04_two_desc:0 "The republic of old sustained cities far more prosperous than many of the busiest ports of the empire through the simple mastery of water. Ensuring running water to every quarter and plenty of water for waste disposal solves many of the problems of urban life, but maintaining the great works of engineering left to us had so far been proven a daunting challenge. With the unification of the Magisterium and the priests of Dame however, a magical shortcut has been found. To the sound of a thousand grumbling wizards and clerics clocking in every day to inglorious menial work manipulating water and divining the needs of each district, the aquaducts, pumps and drains of Dameria return to life every day."
 X04_three:0 "To Plug the Damesneck"
 X04_three_desc:0 "The entirety of the Empire's lifeblood flows through the Damesneck.  Every day, countless trade ships flow through, wary of privateers and rocks as they ferry their cargo to connect the empire and the world. It is over this shallow waterway that the shadow of the republic's navy falls. Consisting of swarms of lithe galleys that can cut the waves with their sharpened bows,  the Damerian navy boasts that it is able to plug the neck at a day's notice...and keep it plugged as long as necessary."
 X04_four:0 "Damerian Drill and Ceremony Manual"
 X04_four_desc:0 "The advent of the printing press saw the Republic commission a series of military manuals for the education of the army from the Order of the Chroniclers. Unexpectedly, this saw a divergence in the ranks, as while for many branches this saw a leap in the development of applied sciences, the merchant marine guards instead saw greater need for pomp and manners when presenting to foreign ports. In no time at all, the visit of Damerian trading fleets became a first class spectacle for the common folk of harbours as far away as Bulwar and the Damerian marines became a  key element of the Damerian foreign image."
 X04_five:0 "Dazzling Damerian Diplomacy"
 X04_five_desc:0 "Due to hosting denizens from the most diverse backgrounds, Dameria was always well suited for diplomacy. It was only with the withering of the nobility and the feudal barriers they maintained that this potential was fully realized under the republic. With diplomats from nearly every race and culture in Cannor now being able to climb the ranks in the imperial palace, Damerian diplomacy could and would greet any partner on their own terms without sacrificing any of the grandeur and debonair that graced the Dameria of old."
 X04_six:0 "This Sceptered Isle"
 X04_six_desc:0 "The Damesear is the heart of Dameria in particular, Anbennar in general and Cannor as a whole. The Magisterium, the Palace, the Parliament, the Adventurer Guilds... a solid half of the institutions of note reside on its shimmering shores. It is the beating heart driving the world around it forward and Damerians consider it their distinguished duty to defend it."
 X04_seven:0 "In Defense of a Dream"
 X04_seven_desc:0 "Every Damerian knows that the light of the republic can be snuffed out once more and a new age of plutocracy and tyranny could arise. Yet they also know that the Damerian Republic cannot truly die. Not while people still hold onto it in their hearts. For centuries it has marched on in the hearts and minds of men and women, and it's dream and promise will live through the centuries that come as long as there are those who cherish and fight for it."

Any time we siege a fortress we have an event called 'Festival of Explosionism' where any Goblin can try their new bomb, missile or whatever on the fortifications. It's a lot of fun and demoralizes the enemy."

 X20_one_desc:0 "Although our ancestors once prowled the cliffs of Aezbel, kidnapping wayward shepherds and merchants, our kin under Matriarch Falahen, shall create the first fleet of ships to facilitate in our ever-expanding hunt. This is a new undertaking for us, should anything terrible happen on the waves, we can at least rely on our wings to ferry provisions back from the mainland."
 X20_two:0 "A Soft Whip"
 X20_two_desc:0 "With the influx of slaves we drag in every month, many are not deemed suitable by the upper elites of Falahen to mate with. Although those of lesser stock are not picky and those mates ill suited would rather be consorts than physical labour, we have come to a compromise. To keep both groups in line, we shall extend mating rights to those slaves who perform well in their given role. Those harpies wishing to have a mate may pick from a handful of candidates before the slaves are taken back, after successfully mating of course."
 X20_three:0 "Consorts of Falahen"
 X20_three_desc:0 "The Falahen Royal family takes its name sake from the Regent Court Deity, Falah, an influence from the teachings of Crathanor preachers kidnapped by our ancestors. With the influx of slaves and mates, the Royal family has taken on many new consorts, many of which share the same religious teachings as Falah and eagerly wish to serve in their roles as advisors of the realm."
 X20_four:0 "Black Sails and Black Wings"
 X20_four_desc:0 "Privateering invokes the idea of unwashed simpletons looting and pillaging the ships and coasts of others, killing and plundering anything that crosses their path. We on the other hand shall make it an official practise in our naval doctrine, the nations of Cannor and Bulwar will come to fear our black winged corsairs soaring high above black flagged vessels."
 X20_five:0 "On the Sunset Sea"
 X20_five_desc:0 "Our sisters have learned the way of oceans, but troubles have begun to arise, many of the Cannorians and Bulwari have begun to use heavily gunned warships in place of the old Carrack designs. Although we may at times struggle to match the raw power of these vessels, we can at least turn the tide in both our manoeuvrability of our fleets and the use of our wings to directly firebomb them from above, causing chaos and pandemonium in their ranks."
 X20_six:0 "Black Winged Warriors and White Cloaked Consorts"
 X20_six_desc:0 "Due to our ability to fly we are able to easily support our sisters and slaves both out at sea and on land, flying in low to drop bombs and directly land trusted consort marines. Although we may never have trusted our Consorts on the front line previously, for they are too precious to lose, our warriors demand that their consorts join them in battle. This phenomenon has allowed both ground and air forces to work in tandem with one another, reducing casualties immensely. This however has had another phenomenon, due to our sisters only being able to carry one mate in their talons to the battlefield, many have opted to forgo multiple consorts and instead only have one mate, insisting that it allows for greater teamwork and stronger offspring. "
 X20_seven:0 "Consort Legions"
 X20_seven_desc:0 "We have finally done away with the concept of slave armies, seeing the effectiveness of the Black Wings and the White Cloaks, we have decided to reform our armed forces to incorporate our consorts onto the battlefield. Although we thought there would be some push back, our warriors have gleefully supported the idea of fighting alongside their mates in battle. This in turn has encouraged many of the potential mates in our domain not in slavery to sign up, with the prospect of being considered a potential mate to our warriors in the future."

 X22_six:0 "Undisputed Rule"
 X22_six_desc:0 "During the Lilac Wars, the main branch made many mistakes, foremost among them being the failure to maintain the loyalty of the Wine Lords. We shall not suffer the same fate.

 X22_seven:0 "The Empire's Legions"

We shall implement a system where every male villager between the ages of 16 and 40 registers with the local royal sheriff allowing us to know how much manpower we can draw on, where it is located, and how to obtain it. This should ensure an easier access to men for the armies."

The reconquest of Dragon Coast by Nimscodd Hierarchy has led to the further development. Now armed with knowledge of not only those of gnomes, but goblins and kobolds as well, we are able to produce weaker versions, but on a far grander scale, not only for our artificers, but the entire army."
 X23_two:0 "The Haraf Home Fleet"
 X23_two_desc:0 "Gommoport has long been considered a major port for any ships travelling between Aelantir and Halless. This led to many outside forces looking to take control over the port, and possibly all of Haraf, for themselves. If we are to do so, we must aim to stop the enemy on the seas before they have the chance to threaten our mainland."
 X23_three:0 "Time To Think"
 X23_three_desc:0 "Whether it is goblins leaving Bayvic or both Gnomes and Kobolds leaving the Dragon Coast, the truth is that none of these people have had the opportunity to truly develop their ideals in peace, not having ample resources nor the time to do so. But Haraf is different, in these new lands where they do not have to worry about constant threats, the minds that were once dormant are now able to flourish."

 X23_five:0 "The First Artificer Army"
 X23_five_desc:0 "Having its foundation in Gommoport, the Tinker army is the first ever artificer army to exist, our people had always lacked when it came down to physical strength compared to many of our neighbours. Instead of mindlessly trying to fight like them, we developed our own way of fighting by creating weapons made by magic. This led to the creation of the most feared army across all of Aelantir and beyond, no colonisers dares to fight the Triarchy on our soil!"
