 X01_ideas_bonus:0 "Gerudian Empire Ambition"
 X01_one:0 "Legacy of the Clans"
 X01_one_desc:0 "In olden times the ruler of a clan would be decided by battle. While this tradition has been a thing of the past we Gerudians still value strength of both body and mind, as well as an inclination to military matters. This is reflected in our rulers as well."
 X01_two:0 "A Reavers Life"
 X01_two_desc:0 "The life of a reaver is embedded deeply into our hearts and culture. To go out to sea, to plunder for slaves and treasure is as natural to us as breathing."
 X01_three:0 "Hardened by the frost"
 X01_three_desc:0 "The winters in Gerudia are cold and tough. It takes a certain type of hardyness and bodily strength that the southerners lack to survive in the cold north. This strong breed of people will not back down in the face of ice and frost, nor to a wound."
 X01_four:0 "The Thing of war"
 X01_four_desc:0 "While our administration is as modern as they come we do not forfeit our traditions. Once every year, at the eve of winter solstice, the leaders of the Gerudian clans meet for the great Thing. Matters of war and battle are discussed and the cheiftains compete, as much with words and strategies as with strength and blade. Whoever sets themself apart are appointed to advise the High King in matters of war."
 X01_five:0 "People of the sea"
 X01_five_desc:0 "We are a seafaring people though and through. While the great longboats are a thing of the past we still heavily rely on ships and boats to connect our Empire. Many a Gerudian has spent part of their lives on a ship, still as many have gone to war on one."
 X01_six:0 "Work or die"
 X01_six_desc:0 "You have no time to slack off in Gerudia. When the winter comes you had better been prepared, unless you want to freeze or starve to death. When the alternative is death, one tends to prefer to work hard."
 X01_seven:0 "Blood of Giants"
 X01_seven_desc:0 "The southerners often claim that Gerudians have inherited the blood of giants, that we are as related to trolls as to other men. While this is obviously untrue us Gerudians grow tall and broad and strong of body. When met in a melee the southerners are quickly dispatched by superior Gerudian strength and blade."

 X04_ideas_bonus:0 "Damerian Republic Ambition"
 X04_one:0 "Friendly neighbourhood Heroes"
 X04_one_desc:0 "Anbencóst has long been the origin point and final destination of many adventures, providing the city with a varied roster of novice , experienced and retired heroes to recruit from in times of trouble. The new government of the republic has concluded that the secret to the city's success was in fact supply. Attracting adventurers with favourable reforms, the right to climb as high as any of the nobility of old  and, most importantly, plenty of attractions and shops to spend their loot on would ensure that for every problem that arises, ten hired heroes would respond."
 X04_two:0 "Waterworks of West Damesear"
 X04_two_desc:0 "The republic of old sustained cities far more prosperous than many of the busiest ports of the empire through the simple mastery of water. Ensuring running water to every quarter and plenty of water for waste disposal solves many of the problems of urban life, but maintaining the great works of engineering left to us had so far been proven a daunting challenge. With the unification of the Magisterium and the priests of Dame however, a magical shortcut has been found. To the sound of a thousand grumbling wizards and clerics clocking in every day to inglorious menial work manipulating water and divining the needs of each district, the aquaducts, pumps and drains of Dameria return to life every day."
 X04_three:0 "To Plug the Damesneck"
 X04_three_desc:0 "The entirety of the Empire's lifeblood flows through the Damesneck.  Every day, countless trade ships flow through, wary of privateers and rocks as they ferry their cargo to connect the empire and the world. It is over this shallow waterway that the shadow of the republic's navy falls. Consisting of swarms of lithe galleys that can cut the waves with their sharpened bows,  the Damerian navy boasts that it is able to plug the neck at a day's notice...and keep it plugged as long as necessary."
 X04_four:0 "Damerian Drill and Ceremony Manual"
 X04_four_desc:0 "The advent of the printing press saw the Republic commission a series of military manuals for the education of the army from the Order of the Chroniclers. Unexpectedly, this saw a divergence in the ranks, as while for many branches this saw a leap in the development of applied sciences, the merchant marine guards instead saw greater need for pomp and manners when presenting to foreign ports. In no time at all, the visit of Damerian trading fleets became a first class spectacle for the common folk of harbours as far away as Bulwar and the Damerian marines became a  key element of the Damerian foreign image."
 X04_five:0 "Dazzling Damerian Diplomacy"
 X04_five_desc:0 "Due to hosting denizens from the most diverse backgrounds, Dameria was always well suited for diplomacy. It was only with the withering of the nobility and the feudal barriers they maintained that this potential was fully realized under the republic. With diplomats from nearly every race and culture in Cannor now being able to climb the ranks in the imperial palace, Damerian diplomacy could and would greet any partner on their own terms without sacrificing any of the grandeur and debonair that graced the Dameria of old."
 X04_six:0 "This Sceptered Isle"
 X04_six_desc:0 "The Damesear is the heart of Dameria in particular, Anbennar in general and Cannor as a whole. The Magisterium, the Palace, the Parliament, the Adventurer Guilds... a solid half of the institutions of note reside on its shimmering shores. It is the beating heart driving the world around it forward and Damerians consider it their distinguished duty to defend it."
 X04_seven:0 "In Defense of a Dream"
 X04_seven_desc:0 "Every Damerian knows that the light of the republic can be snuffed out once more and a new age of plutocracy and tyranny could arise. Yet they also know that the Damerian Republic cannot truly die. Not while people still hold onto it in their hearts. For centuries it has marched on in the hearts and minds of men and women, and it's dream and promise will live through the centuries that come as long as there are those who cherish and fight for it."

They are a great success, even having received honorary titles from the humans. Surely 'Clown' is a title of great honor."
 X12_four:0 "A shared interest"

 X15_three:0 "Flexible building codes"

 X15_five:0 "Explosionism"
 X15_five_desc:0 "We love a good explosion. In fact our engineers have taken to following a philosophy called 'Explosionism'.

However during war times there are lots of sturdy, immobile targets to try our ideas on. Any time we siege a fortress we have an event called 'Festival of Explosionism' where any Goblin can try their new bomb, missile or whatever on the fortifications. It's a lot of fun and demoralizes the enemy."

Although those of lesser stock are not picky and those mates ill suited would rather be consorts than physical labour, we have come to a compromise. To keep both groups in line, we shall extend mating rights to those slaves who perform well in their given role. Those harpies wishing to have a mate may pick from a handful of candidates before the slaves are taken back, after successfully mating of course."

Although we may never have trusted our Consorts on the front line previously, for they are too precious to lose, our warriors demand that their consorts join them in battle. This phenomenon has allowed both ground and air forces to work in tandem with one another, reducing casualties immensely. This however has had another phenomenon, due to our sisters only being able to carry one mate in their talons to the battlefield, many have opted to forgo multiple consorts and instead only have one mate, insisting that it allows for greater teamwork and stronger offspring. "
 X20_seven:0 "Consort Legions"
 X20_seven_desc:0 "We have finally done away with the concept of slave armies, seeing the effectiveness of the Black Wings and the White Cloaks, we have decided to reform our armed forces to incorporate our consorts onto the battlefield. Although we thought there would be some push back, our warriors have gleefully supported the idea of fighting alongside their mates in battle. This in turn has encouraged many of the potential mates in our domain not in slavery to sign up, with the prospect of being considered a potential mate to our warriors in the future."
